Or, if you want a simple program to read/write sketch files to disk and/or convert sketches to images, run the
draw_panel.bat batch program. Note that if you use this program to try and save sketches to image files, we ONLY SUPPORT
PNG. It doesn't matter what you name the file as, it will be encoded as a PNG image. So if you can't open an image
you've saved from a sketch, rename the file to have a PNG extension and try again.
